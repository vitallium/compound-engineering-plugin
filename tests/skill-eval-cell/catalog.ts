/**
 * Skill-eval cells authored from pre-sweep contracts at PRE_SWEEP_REF
 * (parent of #1433), then run against that ref and HEAD (the tree under test).
 *
 * Rows exist only when a prompt plus a grade can fail the claimed invariant.
 * Coverage of every shipped skill is not a goal.
 *
 * Required-read vs body-owned gate:
 * - Omit `files_read_post` when the always-loaded body still states the gate.
 *   Skipping the reference is allowed (the correct negative). Extra reads are not a fail.
 * - Do not add `must_not_read`. Reading a procedure manual is never the defect.
 * - When a reference owns a *different* path, add a complementary cell that
 *   requires that file. Dropping the required-read without that pair drops the
 *   extraction probe for that skill.
